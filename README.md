<p>
            Resources are essential for making anything in                Warcraft II. At the start of most scenarios you start            with a little bit of gold, wood and oil to get you               started. However, you will need to collect more of each          resource in order to conquer the enemy. But don't waste          them, as they are limited.
</p>
        
<h3>Gold</h3>
<p>
            Gold is needed for the making of anything, Things            might not need wood or oil to construct but they will            always use gold. You obtain it by getting a peaseant or a         peon to mine gold out of a gold mine and return to the           town hall to drop it off. Once the mine has no more gold         in it, the mine will dissapear.
        </p>
        
<h3>Wood</h3>
<p>
            Wood is similar to gold. You get a peasant or a peon         to gather it and bring it back to the town hall to drop          it off and you obtain wood. However, building units or           buildings take much less wood than gold to build them            and it takes considerably longer for the worker to obtain         the wood compared to gold.
</p>
        
<h3>Oil</h3>
<p> Oil is needed in large quantities to produce everything nautical.</p>
<h2 id = "units">Units</h2>
<p> There are 3 classes of units in the game. Knowing how to use them properly will make you victorious. They are:</p> 
<h3> Workers </h3> 
<p>Workers are the only units that can build structures and     collect resources. Peasants are the most basic worker and can be built from the town hall. They are also the cheapest units in the game. Oil tankers which can be produced from the shipyard  and are on water can build oil platforms and collect oil from those platforms. Workers are essential to have but be careful as they have low health and cannot fight, so an attacking force can easily destroy them if left unprotected.</p>
    
<h3> Combat</h3> 
 <p> The most basic land combat units only require the barracks to build but more advanced ones require other buildings to build them such as the lumber mill or the stables. The most basic nautical combat units can also be produced in the shipyard but more advanced ones require the foundry to build. Combat units are more expensive than workers but have more health and deal more damage to effectively fight.</p>
<h3>Scouts</h3>
